Hi, I’m Okikiola 👋

I’m a Cloud & DevOps Engineer focused on building reliable, observable systems.
I work mostly with AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.

Right now, I’m sharpening my skills around:
- Infrastructure automation
- Monitoring & observability
- Clean CI/CD workflows

I like practical setups that can actually run, not just diagrams.
